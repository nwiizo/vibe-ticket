# vibe-ticket User Pain Points Analysis

## Executive Summary
This document identifies and analyzes current user pain points in vibe-ticket based on command structure analysis, potential usability issues, and comparison with modern CLI best practices.

## Identified Pain Points

### 1. Command Complexity
**Issue**: Commands require multiple flags and options that may not be intuitive
- Example: `vibe-ticket new slug --title "Title" --priority high --tags "tag1,tag2"`
- **Impact**: High learning curve for new users
- **Severity**: Medium

### 2. Lack of Interactive Guidance
**Issue**: No interactive mode for complex operations
- Users must remember all required flags
- No step-by-step guidance for new users
- **Impact**: Increased error rate and frustration
- **Severity**: High

### 3. Unclear Command Intent
**Issue**: Commands are operation-focused rather than intent-focused
- `new` vs `create-bug` or `plan-feature`
- `edit` vs `update-status` or `assign-to`
- **Impact**: Users need to translate intent to commands
- **Severity**: Medium

### 4. Limited Contextual Help
**Issue**: Error messages and help text could be more contextual
- Generic error messages don't guide users to solutions
- No smart suggestions for common mistakes
- **Impact**: Users resort to documentation frequently
- **Severity**: Medium

### 5. No Template Support
**Issue**: Users must manually structure tickets every time
- No reusable templates for common ticket types
- No project-specific conventions enforcement
- **Impact**: Inconsistent ticket quality and structure
- **Severity**: High

### 6. Complex Workflow Management
**Issue**: Managing tickets across lifecycle requires multiple commands
- No guided workflows for common patterns
- Manual state transitions without validation
- **Impact**: Workflow errors and inefficiency
- **Severity**: Medium

### 7. Limited Discoverability
**Issue**: Advanced features are not easily discoverable
- No progressive disclosure of features
- Complex features hidden behind flags
- **Impact**: Underutilization of powerful features
- **Severity**: Low

### 8. Inconsistent Feedback
**Issue**: Feedback varies across commands
- Some commands are verbose, others silent
- No consistent success/error indication
- **Impact**: Uncertainty about operation results
- **Severity**: Low
