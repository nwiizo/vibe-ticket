# GitHub Spec Kit Patterns Applied to vibe-ticket

## Overview
Analysis of GitHub Spec Kit patterns and their application to vibe-ticket for improved user experience.

## Key Patterns from Spec Kit

### 1. Specification-First Development
**Pattern**: Start with clear specifications before implementation
**Application to vibe-ticket**:
- Add `vibe-ticket spec` command for creating detailed specifications
- Support markdown-based spec files
- Auto-generate tickets from specifications

### 2. Multi-Phase Refinement
**Pattern**: Iterative refinement through distinct phases
**Application**:
```
Phase 1: Intent → vibe-ticket intent "Build user authentication"
Phase 2: Spec → vibe-ticket spec create auth-spec.md
Phase 3: Plan → vibe-ticket plan from-spec auth-spec.md
Phase 4: Execute → vibe-ticket start auth-implementation
```

### 3. Executable Specifications
**Pattern**: Specifications that can be validated and executed
**Application**:
- Validate ticket completeness against spec
- Auto-generate test cases from specs
- Track implementation progress against spec

### 4. Intent-Driven Interface
**Pattern**: Focus on what users want to achieve, not how
**Application**:
```bash
# Current (operation-focused)
vibe-ticket new feature-auth --title "Add authentication"

# Proposed (intent-focused)
vibe-ticket create feature "Add user authentication"
vibe-ticket fix bug "Login fails on mobile"
vibe-ticket plan refactor "Optimize database queries"
```

### 5. Progressive Disclosure
**Pattern**: Reveal complexity gradually
**Application**:
- Basic mode: Simple, guided commands
- Advanced mode: Full feature access
- Expert mode: Scriptable, composable commands

## Proposed Command Structure

### Level 1: Intent Commands (Beginner-Friendly)
```bash
vibe-ticket create [type] [description]
vibe-ticket work-on [ticket]
vibe-ticket finish [ticket]
vibe-ticket review [ticket]
```

### Level 2: Specification Commands (Intermediate)
```bash
vibe-ticket spec new [template]
vibe-ticket spec validate [file]
vibe-ticket spec implement [file]
vibe-ticket spec track [ticket]
```

### Level 3: Advanced Commands (Power Users)
```bash
vibe-ticket workflow define [yaml]
vibe-ticket batch create [csv]
vibe-ticket query "status:open AND priority:high"
vibe-ticket export --format json | jq
```

## Template System Design

### Built-in Templates
```yaml
# bug-template.yaml
type: bug
fields:
  - name: steps_to_reproduce
    type: list
    required: true
  - name: expected_behavior
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: actual_behavior
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: environment
    type: select
    options: [development, staging, production]
```

### Usage
```bash
vibe-ticket create --template bug
# Interactive prompts based on template
```

## Interactive Mode Design

### Guided Creation Flow
```
$ vibe-ticket create --interactive
? What would you like to create? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Feature - New functionality
  Bug - Something isn't working
  Task - General work item
  Refactor - Code improvement

? Provide a brief title: Add user authentication

? Select priority: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Low
  Medium
  High
  Critical

? Add tags (comma-separated, optional): security, backend

? Would you like to add a detailed description? (Y/n)

? Start working on this ticket now? (Y/n)
```

## Smart Suggestions System

### Context-Aware Help
```bash
$ vibe-ticket edit non-existent-ticket
Error: Ticket 'non-existent-ticket' not found

Did you mean one of these?
  - existing-ticket-1
  - existing-ticket-2

To see all tickets, run: vibe-ticket list
To create a new ticket, run: vibe-ticket create
```

### Command Predictions
```bash
$ vibe-ticket st
Did you mean 'start'? (Y/n)

$ vibe-ticket list --status=op
Did you mean '--status=open'? (Y/n)
```

## Workflow Automation

### Common Workflows
```yaml
# .vibe-ticket/workflows/feature.yaml
name: feature-development
steps:
  - create:
      template: feature
      auto_start: true
  - on_start:
      create_branch: true
      create_worktree: true
  - on_complete:
      create_pr: true
      run_tests: true
  - on_merge:
      close_ticket: true
      cleanup_worktree: true
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Phase 1)
   - Interactive mode for ticket creation
   - Basic template support
   - Intent-based command aliases

2. **Medium Priority** (Phase 2)
   - Specification system
   - Smart suggestions
   - Workflow automation

3. **Low Priority** (Phase 3)
   - Advanced query system
   - Batch operations
   - Custom template creation

## Success Indicators

- 50% reduction in command errors
- 70% of new users successfully create first ticket
- 40% adoption rate of interactive mode
- 30% reduction in time to complete common workflows
