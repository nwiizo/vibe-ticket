# Retrospective: Import Feature Testing - 2025-07-28

## Summary
Completed comprehensive testing for the vibe-ticket import functionality, including unit tests and integration tests for JSON, YAML, and CSV import formats.

## What Went Well
- Successfully created 10 comprehensive integration tests covering all major import scenarios
- Added 5 detailed unit tests for the import module functions
- All tests pass successfully
- Import functionality verified to work correctly with real data
- Error handling properly tested and working as expected
- Support for multiple import formats (JSON array, JSON object, YAML, CSV) all functional

## Challenges Encountered
- Initial test failures due to Task UUID format requirements - tasks in JSON needed proper UUID format, not simple strings
- Test assertions were comparing against non-existent `list()` method - needed to use `load_all_tickets()` instead
- Worktree path generation test was incorrect - fixed by updating the expected path format
- Some ticket status inconsistencies found in the system (tickets showing as TODO that were already completed)

## Improvements for Next Time
- Create a test data generator utility to simplify creating valid test fixtures
- Add more edge case tests for malformed data scenarios
- Consider implementing a ticket status audit command to identify and fix inconsistencies
- Add performance tests for large-scale imports (1000+ tickets)

## Follow-up Tickets Created
No new tickets were created as part of this work, but identified potential improvements:
- Ticket status consistency checker tool
- Import progress indicator for large files
- Import rollback functionality for failed imports

## Lessons Learned
- The import feature is robust and handles various formats well
- Task serialization requires full UUID format, not abbreviated IDs
- Integration tests are valuable for catching real-world usage issues
- The vibe-ticket system has some status tracking inconsistencies that should be addressed
- Test coverage is now significantly improved for the import functionality

## Code Changes Summary
1. Created `/tests/test_import.rs` with 10 comprehensive integration tests
2. Enhanced `/src/cli/handlers/import.rs` with 5 additional unit tests
3. Fixed test in `/src/cli/handlers/start.rs` for worktree path generation
4. All changes improve test coverage and ensure import functionality reliability

## Metrics
- Tests added: 15 (10 integration + 5 unit)
- Test coverage improvement: Significant increase for import module
- Time spent: ~10 minutes
- Tickets completed: 2 (Test Import Feature, Another Import Test)
