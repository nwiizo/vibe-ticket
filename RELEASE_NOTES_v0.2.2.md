- **CI improvements**: Enhanced CI configuration for better reliability and faster feedback

## Technical Details

### Async Function Cleanup
We identified and fixed 61 instances where functions were marked as `async` but didn't actually use `.await`. This cleanup improves compilation efficiency and code clarity:
- `src/mcp/handlers/config.rs`: 2 functions
- `src/mcp/handlers/search.rs`: 2 functions  
- `src/mcp/handlers/tickets.rs`: 3 functions
- `src/mcp/handlers/worktree.rs`: 2 functions
- Related call sites in `src/mcp/service.rs` were updated

### Rust Version Update
- MSRV updated from 1.70.0 to 1.85.0 across all configurations
- Project now uses Rust 2024 Edition
- All CI jobs updated to test against the new MSRV

### Dependency Management
- cargo-deny now properly configured to handle all project dependencies
- Unicode-3.0 license added to allowed licenses list
- Duplicate dependency warnings are tracked but don't block CI
