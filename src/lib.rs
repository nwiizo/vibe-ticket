//! vibe-ticket - A high-performance ticket management system for developers
//!
//! This crate provides a comprehensive ticket management solution with features including:
//! - Git worktree integration for parallel development
//! - Concurrent access protection with automatic file locking
//! - Spec-driven development with three-phase workflow
//! - Task management within tickets
//! - Multiple export/import formats
//!
//! # Concurrent Safety
//!
//! All operations in vibe-ticket are safe for concurrent access. The storage layer
//! automatically handles file locking to prevent data corruption when multiple
//! processes or users access tickets simultaneously. Lock files are created
//! transparently and cleaned up automatically, with built-in retry logic for
//! smooth operation under contention.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use vibe_ticket::storage::{FileStorage, TicketRepository};
//! use vibe_ticket::core::Ticket;
//!
//! // Initialize storage
//! let storage = FileStorage::new(".vibe-ticket");
//!
//! // Create a ticket (automatically locked during write)
//! let ticket = Ticket::new("fix-bug".to_string(), "Fix login bug".to_string());
//! storage.save(&ticket)?;
//!
//! // Multiple processes can safely access tickets
//! let loaded = storage.load(&ticket.id)?;
//! ```
