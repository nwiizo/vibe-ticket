title: Improve vibe-ticket UX using Spec-Driven Development principles from GitHub Spec Kit
description: |-
  ## Overview
  Enhance vibe-ticket's user experience by adopting Spec-Driven Development principles from GitHub Spec Kit. Focus on intent-driven development and user-centric design to make the tool more intuitive and efficient.

  ## Background
  GitHub Spec Kit emphasizes:
  - Intent-driven development (what before how)
  - User-centric design
  - Multi-step refinement of specifications
  - Executable specifications

  ## Goals
  1. Improve command structure to be more intent-focused
  2. Enhance user feedback and guidance
  3. Simplify complex workflows
  4. Add specification-driven ticket creation

  ## Proposed Improvements

  ### 1. Intent-Driven Commands
  - Redesign commands to focus on user intent rather than technical operations
  - Example: Instead of `vibe-ticket new`, consider `vibe-ticket create-task` or `vibe-ticket plan-feature`

  ### 2. Guided Workflows
  - Add interactive mode for complex operations
  - Provide step-by-step guidance for new users
  - Implement progressive disclosure of advanced features

  ### 3. Specification Templates
  - Create templates for common ticket types (bug, feature, refactor)
  - Support structured specification format
  - Allow users to define custom templates

  ### 4. Enhanced Feedback
  - Clearer success/error messages
  - Progress indicators for long operations
  - Contextual help and suggestions

  ### 5. Workflow Automation
  - Auto-detect project type and suggest appropriate workflows
  - Smart defaults based on project context
  - Integration with development tools

  ## Implementation Phases

  ### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
  - Analyze current user pain points
  - Study Spec Kit's approach in detail
  - Create user journey maps

  ### Phase 2: Design
  - Design new command structure
  - Create specification templates
  - Plan interactive workflows

  ### Phase 3: Implementation
  - Refactor command interface
  - Add specification support
  - Implement guided workflows

  ### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
  - User testing with feedback collection
  - Iterate based on feedback
  - Documentation updates

  ## Success Metrics
  - Reduced time to create tickets
  - Decreased error rate in ticket creation
  - Improved user satisfaction scores
  - Increased adoption of advanced features
