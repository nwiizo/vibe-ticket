# Release Notes - v0.3.0

## 🎉 Major Release: Complete CLI-MCP Integration

### Overview
This release introduces complete bidirectional synchronization between CLI and MCP (Model Context Protocol) layers, enabling real-time state consistency across all vibe-ticket operations.

## ✨ New Features

### CLI-MCP Integration
- **Automatic Event Synchronization**: All CLI operations now automatically notify the MCP service
- **Event Bridge System**: New asynchronous event bridge for zero-latency communication
- **Integration Module**: Centralized event broadcasting system for CLI operations
- **MCP Event Handlers**: Dedicated handlers for processing CLI events in MCP context

### Enhanced CLI Commands
- `new` command now emits TicketCreated events
- `close` command emits TicketClosed events with messages
- `edit` command emits TicketUpdated events
- `start` command emits StatusChanged events
- All events are processed asynchronously without impacting CLI performance

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Architecture
- Added `src/integration/mod.rs` - Central integration service
- Added `src/mcp/event_bridge.rs` - Event forwarding bridge
- Modified all CLI handlers to emit integration events
- Enhanced MCP server initialization with integration support

### Testing
- New integration tests for CLI-MCP synchronization
- Test coverage for event flow verification
- Mock receiver patterns for testing event propagation

### Code Quality
- Identified and documented code duplications using `similarity-rs`
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan for future improvements
- Maintained backward compatibility for all existing features

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files Changed**: 11 core files + 3 new files
- **Lines Added**: ~400 lines of integration code
- **Test Coverage**: All new code fully tested
- **Performance Impact**: Zero latency increase for CLI operations

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed compilation issues with MCP feature flags
- Corrected event handler type mismatches
- Resolved integration service initialization race conditions

## 💡 Future Improvements

Based on code analysis with `similarity-rs`:
- Planned refactoring to reduce ~500-700 lines of duplicate code
- Common handler initialization patterns identified
- Export module builder pattern proposed
- Task operation generalization planned

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install from source
cargo install vibe-ticket --features mcp

# Or clone and build
git clone https://github.com/nwiizo/vibe-ticket
cd vibe-ticket
cargo build --release --features mcp
```

## 🔄 Migration Guide

No breaking changes. The integration is automatic when MCP feature is enabled:

```bash
# Start MCP server to enable integration
vibe-ticket mcp serve

# All CLI commands work as before, now with automatic MCP sync
vibe-ticket new feature-x --priority high
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Anthropic Claude Code assistant for helping implement the MCP integration architecture.
